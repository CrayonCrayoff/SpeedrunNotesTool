Skip some cutscenes and slip along the linear comp path and you'll start the Gregar fight.
##End of Split##
Gregar:
Gregar is one of the easiest final bosses in the series, but you do need to understand how to fight him.

Gregar has two hitboxes: one is in his head, and one is in his body right behind his head. If you hit both boxes simultaneously, you will deal double damage. This is the main idea.
First turn HeatCross. Pick as many elemental chips as you can. (We want non-elemental chips for charging later.)

Gregar will drop down two times, dropping rocks. One of the rocks is always going to drop where you're standing.
Make sure you charge your flamethrower, and to stay in the middle row after his second drop! 
Right before he drops down for the third time, stand in the middle or front column (still middle row), and unleash your flamethrower down the middle. (He needs to drop down on it for us to get both hitboxes simultaneously.)
If you're lucky, he'll do a fire breath attack. You will be able to charge another flamethrower immediately. If he does a lightning attack, be a little sad but continue on.

On your second turn, beast out and pick as many null element chips as you can. Same pattern, except this time we want to end on either the top or bottom row in the middle column. You can wait to see what kind of attack he does now. 
If he does fire breath, tough luck. You're taking damage. Flame breath him in return. Make sure to hit both boxes.
If he does his lightning attack, step up or down as needed to dodge it, then flame breath. Rinse repeat.  

After 3 total breath attacks, he will do a machine gun attack on the column you're standing. Just step forward or back to dodge and flame breath his face some more. 

After the machine gun attack, he'll do one more breath attack, then do a claw swipe/headbutt combo. DODGE THE CLAWS.
The claws steal your chips, which you kinda need to charge flame breaths. The head isn't such a big deal. 

With these tips, Gregar should go down fairly quickly. Just try to play it safe, dodge as many of his attacks as you can.
