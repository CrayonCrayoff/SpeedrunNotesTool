This is the starting screen of the SpeedrunNotesTool. It can show notes and maps. 

Essentially, it keeps track of two lists: one for notes and one for maps. 

For maps, it checks the folder called "maps". It takes all the files in this folder (please make sure there are only images in there), and then puts them in alphabetical order. So to get the maps to show up in the right order, the file names need to be in alphabetical order.

For the text notes, it will check the text file called TheNotes.txt and read all the lines from it. It determines where the end of a split is by looking for lines that start with the exact phrase "##End of Split##" (it's also case-sensitive). You can edit the text file to add in your own notes. 

The hotkeys it responds to are hard-coded in. There is currently no way to edit these, but I'm hoping to add that functionality sometime soon. The hotkeys for this build are as follows:

Next Split	= F1
Undo Split	= F3
Skip Split	= F4
Next Map	= F5
Previous Map	= F6
Reset 		= F2
Swap Modes	= F8
Close Program 	= Escape (To prevent accidental closing, this only works if the program is in focus.)

All of these hotkeys (with the exception of closing the program) will work even if the program is running in the background. It doesn't need to be in focus. 

You can quit the program by pressing the close button at the top right. 

Finally, the tool can be resized to whatever size you like. It will adjust horizontal text wrapping (for notes) and image size (for maps) to fit the screen. Unfortunately, it won't save these dimensions (also something I will add eventually), so it will always start up with the same dimensions. 

This page is part of TheNotes.txt as well. Please keep this part in when editing. To properly line up with the way LiveSplit functions, it's important to have one screen of text before the start of the actual notes. You might notice there's also one "split" at the end that just says "Good job!". That is there for the same reason.

Skip some cutscenes and slip along the linear comp path and you'll start the Gregar fight.
##End of Split##
Gregar:
Gregar is one of the easiest final bosses in the series, but you do need to understand how to fight him.	

Gregar has two hitboxes: one is in his head, and one is in his body right behind his head. If you hit both boxes simultaneously, you will deal double damage. This is the main idea.
First turn HeatCross. Pick as many elemental chips as you can. (We want non-elemental chips for charging later.)

Gregar will drop down two times, dropping rocks. One of the rocks is always going to drop where you're standing.
Make sure you charge your flamethrower, and to stay in the middle row after his second drop! 
Right before he drops down for the third time, stand in the middle or front column (still middle row), and unleash your flamethrower down the middle. (He needs to drop down on it for us to get both hitboxes simultaneously.)
If you're lucky, he'll do a fire breath attack. You will be able to charge another flamethrower immediately. If he does a lightning attack, be a little sad but continue on.

On your second turn, beast out and pick as many null element chips as you can. Same pattern, except this time we want to end on either the top or bottom row in the middle column. You can wait to see what kind of attack he does now. 
If he does fire breath, tough luck. You're taking damage. Flame breath him in return. Make sure to hit both boxes.
If he does his lightning attack, step up or down as needed to dodge it, then flame breath. Rinse repeat.  

After 3 total breath attacks, he will do a machine gun attack on the column you're standing. Just step forward or back to dodge and flame breath his face some more. 

After the machine gun attack, he'll do one more breath attack, then do a claw swipe/headbutt combo. DODGE THE CLAWS.
The claws steal your chips, which you kinda need to charge flame breaths. The head isn't such a big deal. 

With these tips, Gregar should go down fairly quickly. Just try to play it safe, dodge as many of his attacks as you can.
