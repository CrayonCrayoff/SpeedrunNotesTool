This is CrayonCrayoff's SpeedrunNotesTool. It can show text and images. 

Essentially, it keeps track of two lists: one for notes and one for maps. 

For maps, it checks the folder called "maps". It takes all the files in this folder (please make sure there are only images in there), and then puts them in alphabetical order. So to get the maps to show up in the right order, the file names need to be in alphabetical order.

For the text notes, it will check the text file called TheNotes.txt and read all the lines from it. It determines where the end of a split is by looking for lines that start with the exact phrase "##End of Split##" (it's also case-sensitive). You can edit the text file to add in your own notes. 

You can press the "Settings" button to open a new window to configure your own hotkeys for navigating through notes and maps. The program saves these for next time, so you only have to do this once. 

The program will only listen to your keyboard inputs once you've pressed the "Start Run" button. This button will bring you to a "waiting screen". Once you press the hotkey for "Next Split", it will show your notes.

While running, the program will respond to hotkeys even if it is running in the background. It doesn't need to be in focus. To prevent accidental closing of the program, the "Close Program" hotkey will only work if the program is in focus. 

You can also quit the program by pressing the close button at the top right. 

Finally, the tool can be resized to whatever size you like. It will adjust horizontal text wrapping (for notes) and image size (for maps) to fit the screen.
It will save these dimensions as well as its position on the screen, so it'll be right where you left it last time the next time you open it up.
